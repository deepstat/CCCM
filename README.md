# Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Multivariate Measurements

This repository contains the R code used in the paper "Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Multivariate Measurements".

## Introduction

This paper proposes a novel method for assessing the agreement of multivariate measurement data: the Concordance Correlation Coefficient for Multivariate Measurements (CCCM). The R code in this repository provides the CCCM and Matrix Concordance Correlation Coefficient (MCCC) calculation method presented in the paper.
